# Echo Socket Example

This is a repository with a simple Echo Socket server in Ruby. I made this just for academic purposes :D.

## How to Run?

Obs.: I used ruby on version 2.6.3, so, I recommend you to execute the scripts in this project with this version.

1. Run `ruby server.rb` to execute the TCP Socket Server.
2. Run, in another terminal instance `ruby client.rb`, see the outputs in the two terminals and be happy :D.

Feel free to change the code to behave in the way your examples and tests demand, like getting a dynamic text from the bash input and whatever you want to do.
